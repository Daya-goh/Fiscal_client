## Description
A personal day to day expense tracker to help users track their expenses and plan out their daily budget. Users can see the monthly overview of the different expenses and savings. There are many expense trackers in the market, however, most showed a monthly view. Hence, our team wanted to make an expense app for people who prefers to see the amount of money they can spend day to day. 

## WireFrames
Project 3 is a group project, therefore having clear and precise wireframes is important to help everyone in the team understand the requirements of the projects. With the wireframes, we are able to breakdown the project into components and discuss possible reusable components for application.
We wireframed the main pages of our application - login, landing, expenses and logs. Due to time constraints, we did not go into detailed wireframing of each page but leave it to each of the group members to explore on the design and UI. We discussed and noted down the user stories with our combined past experiences on expense trackers.

## Crux of the project
The crux of the project is the ease of use of the application but also have the most important functionalities. We do not want to overcomplicate the design hence we kept it simple and we focused on the functionality of the application.

On the landing page, we wanted the users to be able to tell at a glance their current expenditure status/health.

For users to see all the past transactions, a container has to be set up for each day. As the months of the year are different, it is important to generate the correct number of containers for each month with daily budget and expenses logged components in them accurately.

An expense tracker is to help users track and manage their expenses over the month. Hence, it is important to show them the consolidated breakdown of the expenses per month and year. We made use of a chart library to help out chart out the different categories in a visually appealling yet easy to read and understand for our application.

## Key Learning and AFI
Managing a full project requires a lot of detailed planning and communication between team members. If more time we given, we hope to do a more detailed planning of the application and communicate more between the members. 
We would want to look into different ways of displaying the transactions page and also adding more functions like giving users the users options to choose between daily allowance and monthly allowance view.
